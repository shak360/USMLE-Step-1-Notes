## Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH_4)

A cofactor in the synthesis of serotonin, tyrosine, and DOPA (the antecedent of neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). The hydroxylation steps of phenylalanine to tyrosine and of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan require the use of both dihydrobiopterin reductase and phenylalanine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase respectively.

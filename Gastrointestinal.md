## Esophagus

### *Candida albicans*

Patches of white-colored pseudomembranes in the erythematous mucosa. Yeast cells and pseudohyphae on invading mucosa.

### Cytomegalovirus

Large, shallow ulcerations. Cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions ("owl eyes")

### Herpes simplex virus

Punched-out ulcers and small vesicles. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions (Cowdry Type A bodies) in epithelial cells.

## Liver

### Centrilobular necrosis

Centrilobular necrosis is seen with hepatocyte injury such as acetominophen toxicity, chornic passive congestion, halothane toxicity, carbon tetrachloride, and ischemia. The zone 3 hepatocytes located closest to the central vein have a higher cytochrome P450 activity, whereas the periportal zone 2 hepatocytes have higher respiratory enzyme activity. Increased P450 activity causes increased metabolite formation, which can lead to centrilocbular necrosis. In addition, reduced glutathione or reduced blood flow in zone 3 may also cause centrilobular necrosisis.

## Adrenergics

## Cholinergics

### Muscarinic Agonists

#### Organophosphates

Pesticides that cause irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, resulting in increased acetylcholine levels and both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor activation.  Organophosphate poisoning leads to cholinergic crises and can be seen in those who do farm work. Organophosphate poisoning presents as fecal and urinary incontinence, miosis (constriction of the pupils), bronchospasm, bradycardia, salivation, and diaphoresis.

### Muscarinic Antagonists

#### Atropine

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. The antidote for organophosphate poisoning. Atropine competitively inhibits the effects of organophosphate poisoning at the muscarinic inhibitors.

#### Pralidoxime

Because atropine does not act on nicotinic receptors, it cannot reverse any neuromuscular dysfunction caused by organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime, a cholinesterase reactivator, is also effective in treating the nicotinic effects of organophosphate poisoning and should be given in addition to atropine.

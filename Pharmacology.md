## Ophthalmology

### Miosis

#### alpha-1 Antagonists

#### M3 Agonists -- Blurred far vision

- Carbachol
- Physostigmine
- Pilocarpine

### Mydriasis

#### alpha-1 Agonists

- Norepinephrine -- Norepinephrine causes mydriasis via stimulation of Î±1-receptors on the pupillary dilator but has no effect on the ciliary muscle or curvature on the lens and preserves accommodation.

#### M3 Antagonists -- Blurred near vision

- Atropine

## Pathology

### Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Syndrome 

Commonly associated drugs include anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, allopurinol, sulfonamides (sulfasalazine), and antibiotics. Patients typically develop fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, facial edema, and a diffuse morbilliform skin rash that can progress to a confluent erythema.

## Adrenergics

## Cholinergics

### Muscarinic Agonists

#### Organophosphates

Pesticides that cause **irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase,** resulting in increased acetylcholine levels and both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor activation.  Organophosphate poisoning leads to cholinergic crises and can be seen in those who do farm work. Organophosphate poisoning presents as fecal and urinary incontinence, miosis (constriction of the pupils), bronchospasm, bradycardia, salivation, and diaphoresis.

### Muscarinic Antagonists

#### Atropine

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. The antidote for organophosphate poisoning. Atropine competitively inhibits the effects of organophosphate poisoning at the muscarinic inhibitors.

Atropine causes mydriasis and cycloplegia (the loss of accommodation) via inhibition of the ciliary muscle.

#### Pralidoxime

Because atropine does not act on nicotinic receptors, it cannot reverse any neuromuscular dysfunction caused by organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime, a cholinesterase reactivator, is also effective in treating the nicotinic effects of organophosphate poisoning and should be given in addition to atropine.

# Anatomy & Musculoskeletal

## Arms

### Median nerve

#### Proximal median nerve injury

"Hand of benediction"

Proximal median nerve injury classically presents with the inability to flex the second and third MCP joints.


### Radial nerve (C5-T1)

#### Proximal radial nerve injury 

This palsy is often caused by pressure or trauma to the axilla by an ill-fitting crutch or if an individual sleeps with an arm over a chair ("Saturday night palsy"). Injury to the nerve at this location may cause weakness or paralysis to the forearm, hand, and finger extensor muscles (wrist drop, absent triceps reflex) and may also cause sensory losses over the posterior arm and forearm, dorsolateral hand, and dorsal thumb.

More distal lesions (midshaft humeral fractures) spare the triceps brachii, as the fibers innervating this muscle leave the nerve before it enters the radial groove.

## Legs

### Sciatic nerve

Motor - Knee flexion

### Common fibular (peroneal) nerve

Motor - Dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot

Sensory - Lateral calf and dorsal surface of the foot

Trauma/sustained pressure to the neck of the fibula can injure the common fibular nerve, causing weakness on foot dorsiflexion and eversion along with impaired sensation over the lateral shin, dorsal foot, and between the first and second toes.

### Tibial nerve

Motor - Plantar flexion and inversion

Sensory - Plantar surface of the foot

Reflex - Ankle (Achilles)

## Lipids

### Primary lipid disorders

#### Type I Hyperchylomicronemia (AR)

#### Type II Familial Hypercholesterolemia (AD)

Defect in the *LDL receptor and the ApoB-100* lipoprotein. Almost everything is elevated except triglycerides usually. In type IIb, VLDL is also elevated. One ses accelerated atherosclerosis, tendom xanthomas, xanthelasmas, and corneal arcus.

#### Type III Dysbetalipoproteinemia (AR)

#### Type IV Hypertriglyceridemia (AD)

## Purine salvage deficiencies

### Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (XR)

HGRPT deficiency results in macrocytic anemia, which is characterized by the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils and is evidenced by this patient’s pallor. Because guanine and hypoxanthine are being lost as uric acid, the de novo synthesis pathway for purines must compensate; this compensation pathway utilizes folate and vitamin B12. This increased requirement for folate and vitamin B12 can result in macrocytic anemia (also called “megaloblastic anemia”); in a peripheral blood smear, the most prominent feature of this condition is the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils.

HGPRT:

- Hyperuricemia
- Gout
- Pissed off (aggression,self-mutilation)
- Red/orange crystals in urine
- Tense muscles (dystonia)

### Adenosine deaminase deficiency

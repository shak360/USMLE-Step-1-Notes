## Disorders of fructose metabolism

### Fructokinase deficiency or Essential fructosuria

FructoKINase is KINder.

Benign and asymoptomatic condition.

### Aldolase B deficiency or Hereditary fructose intolerance

## Disorders of galactose metabolism 

### Galactokinase deficiency

Hereditary deficiency of galactokinase.Galactitol accumulates if galactose is present in diet. Relatively mild condition.Autosomal recessive.

Symptoms: galactos eappears in blood (galactosemia) and urine (galactosuria); infantile cataracts.
May present as failure to track objects or to develop a social smile.

Galactokinase deficiency is kinder (benign condition).

### Classic galactosemia

Classic galactosemia (type 1) presents within the first days of life with failure to thrive, lethargy, feeding difficulties, and liver failure.

Classic galactosemia is caused by deficiency in the enzyme GALT, which leads to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate and galactitol.

Absence of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. Autosomal recessive. Damage is caused by the accumulation of toxic substance (including galactitol, which accumulates in the lens of the eye).

Smptoms develop when infant behins feeding (lactose present in breast milk and routine formula) and include failure to thrive, jaundice, hepatomegaly, infantile cataracts, intellectual disability.

**Can predispose to E coli sepsis in neonates.**

## Glycogen storage disorders

### Pompe disease (type II)

LYSOSOMAL ACID MALTASE (alpha-1,4-glucosidase)

Cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, exercise intolerance, enlarged tongue, early death

## Metabolic disorders

### Respiratory Acidosis

### Metabolic Acidosis

#### Elevated anion gap MA ( Na-(Cl+HCO3)>12 )

GOLDMARK

##### L-lactate

L-Lactic acid is produced in the cytoplasm of the cell in anaerobic conditions and can cause metabolic acidosis in the setting of ischemia (see acute mesenteric ischemia). Glycolysis is the biochemical pathway in which glucose is oxidized to pyruvate within the cytosol. In anaerobic conditions such as ischemia, pyruvate is converted to L-lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase within the cytoplasm. Subsequently, levels of serum L-lactic acid increase, resulting in metabolic acidosis. Other causes of L-lactic acidosis are sepsis and toxicity due to isoniazid, aspirin, or metformin.

##### D-lactate

D-lactic acid (exogenous lactic acid) is increased in patients with short bowel syndrome (surgical removal of the small intestine) or, less commonly, in patients with propylene glycol toxicity. In short bowel syndrome, the unabsorbed carbohydrates are metabolized by gut bacteria to D-lactic acid, increasing the serum level.

#### Normal anion gap MA ( Na-(Cl+HCO3)<12 )

## Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)

A cofactor in the synthesis of serotonin, tyrosine, and DOPA (the antecedent of neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). The hydroxylation steps of phenylalanine to tyrosine and of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan require the use of both dihydrobiopterin reductase and phenylalanine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase respectively. 

## Lipids

### Primary lipid disorders

#### Type I Hyperchylomicronemia (AR)

Defect or decrease in *lipoprotein lipase and Apo CII* lipoprotein. One would see elevated chylomicrons, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Clinically,a  milky or creamy supernatant would be seen in blood analysis. Patients also present with acute pancreatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis, and eruptive xanthomas.

##### Weird fact/trick question

4M + recurrent pancreatitis + high serum cholesterol and TGAs + receives an injection of heparin and
this restores his serum lipoprotein lipase activity; which of the following is decreased in this patient;
answer = ApoC-II; familial hyperchylomicronemia.

Usually, LPL is made and then bound to the vascular endothelium (sticking on the cell membranes and pointing into the vessel) but when someone receives heparin, it displaces LPL from the vascular endothelium and releases it into circulation where it can go do its usual thing (which is to degrade triglycerides in circulating chylomicrons).

The reason vessels have LPL stuck on their endothelium is that chylomicrons circulating in the bloodstream can stop by and donate TGs and FFA to the cells (emptying themselves) and turn into chylomicron remnants, but if you don't have lipoprotein lipase in  your vascular endothelium (because of heparin) then that never happens, and you get elevated chylomicrons, triglycerides in the blood, hyperchylomicronemia.

##### Question

A 3-year-old boy is brought by his parents to the pediatrician with acute epigastric pain that radiates to his back and worsens after meals. His temperature is 38.4°C (101.2°F). On physical examination, the patient appears thin and athletic. The abdomen is tender and slightly distended with guarding. Bowel sounds are diminished. Serum lipase concentration is increased. Blood draw shows plasma that has a milky-white color.

"acute epigastric pain that radiates to his back and worsens after meals" is important for pancreatitis. "Blood draw shows plasma that has a milky-white color" is the creamy layer in supernatant.

Answer: **Deficiency in lipoprotein lipoase** *not* ~~Increase in Apo CII levels~~

#### Type II Familial Hypercholesterolemia (AD)

Defect in the *LDL receptor and the ApoB-100* lipoprotein. Almost everything is elevated except triglycerides usually. In type IIb, VLDL is also elevated. One ses accelerated atherosclerosis, tendom xanthomas, xanthelasmas, and corneal arcus.

#### Type III Dysbetalipoproteinemia (AR)

#### Type IV Hypertriglyceridemia (AD)

## Purine salvage deficiencies

### Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (XR)

HGRPT deficiency results in macrocytic anemia, which is characterized by the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils and is evidenced by this patient’s pallor. Because guanine and hypoxanthine are being lost as uric acid, the de novo synthesis pathway for purines must compensate; this compensation pathway utilizes folate and vitamin B12. This increased requirement for folate and vitamin B12 can result in macrocytic anemia (also called “megaloblastic anemia”); in a peripheral blood smear, the most prominent feature of this condition is the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils.

HGPRT:

- Hyperuricemia
- Gout
- Pissed off (aggression,self-mutilation)
- Red/orange crystals in urine
- Tense muscles (dystonia)

### Adenosine deaminase deficiency

## Genital Embryology

### Mesonephric ducts

The prostate does not develop from the mesonephric ducts. The mesonephric ducts develop into the male internal genital structures, which can be remembered with the mnemonic BEEDS: Bladder trigone, Epididymis, Ejaculatory duct, Ductus deferens, Seminal vesicles.

The femal remnant is the Gardner duct.

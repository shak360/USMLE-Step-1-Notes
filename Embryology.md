## Genital Embryology

### Mesonephric ducts

The prostate does not develop from the mesonephric ducts. The mesonephric ducts develop into the male internal genital structures, which can be remembered with the mnemonic BEEDS: Bladder trigone, Epididymis, Ejaculatory duct, Ductus deferens, Seminal vesicles.

The femal remnant is the Gardner duct.

## Kidney Embryology

### POTTER Sequence

Potter syndrome (or sequence) is a fetal disorder in which compression of the fetus by the uterine wall causes limb deformities (eg, the clubbed feet, rotated internally, seen in the photo), abnormal facies, and pruned skin. This occurs due to oligohydramnios (no fetal urine excretion and thus reduced amniotic fluid volume), which leads to inadequate cushioning of the fetus in the amniotic sac. Pulmonary hypoplasia is also a consequence because lung development is affected by the reduced intrauterine space, lung liquid volume and pressure, and breathing movements. Death occurs shortly after birth unless a kidney transplant is done.

The most common cause of Potter sequence is bilateral renal agenesis, which results from a failure of the ureteric bud to develop or reach the metanephric mesoderm. The renal collecting system is derived from the ureteric bud. Other causes of Potter sequence are autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, and hypoplastic kidney.

#### Difficult question

A 39-year-old woman, G1P0, comes to the office for a prenatal visit. The patient is at 27 weeks gestation by last menstrual period and has received no previous prenatal care. She has had no vaginal bleeding, leakage of fluid, or contractions. The patient has chronic hypertension. on examination, BMI is 19 kg/m2, and the uterine fundus measures 22 cm. A transabdominal ultrasound reveals a severely growth-restricted fetus with pulmonary hypoplasia and bilateral small, underdeveoped kidneys. Measurement of the amniotic fluid shows oligohydramnios. Which of the following is the most likeley cause of this patient's presentation?

Answer: **Medication adverse effect** *not* ~~Fetal posterior urethral valves~~

This patient's fetal ultrasound reveals small, underdeveloped fetal kidneys and oligohydramnios consistent with <strong>fetal renal hypoplasia</strong>. The most likely cause is maternal use of an <strong>ACE inhibitor</strong> or angiotensin II receptor blocker <strong>(ARB)</strong> during pregnancy, as suggested by this patient's history of chronic hypertension and late presentation to prenatal care.

##### *But what about POTTER sequence (bilateral renal hypo/agenesis)?*

Because fetal urine is the main component of amniotic fluid, fetal renal hypoplasia typically equates to low amniotic fluid levels (ie, <strong>oligohydramnios</strong>).&nbsp; Amniotic fluid is vital for fetal lung development, and normal levels typically protect against fetal compression; in contrast, chronically low levels can lead to <strong>pulmonary hypoplasia</strong> and limb compression or deformity (ie,Potter sequence). Low amniotic fluid levels also correspond with low fundal height and restriction of fetal movement that can contribute to severe <strong>fetal growth restriction</strong>.

Fetal posterior urethral valves, membranes that obstruct the urethra, can cause decreased fetal urine output and resultant oligohydramnios.&nbsp; However, the backup of urine typically causes bilateral hydronephrosis (ie, large kidneys) rather than small, underdeveloped kidneys.

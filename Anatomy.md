## Carotid sheath

When placing an internal jugular venous line, the common carotid artery is medial, the internal jugular vein is lateral, and the vagus nerve is posterior within the carotid sheath. 

The most common central veins used for central venous line access are the internal jugular, femoral, and subclavian veins. In the neck, the internal jugular vein runs alongside the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve within a fibrous, tubular sheath called the carotid sheath, shown in the red portion in the figure. Within this sheath, the common carotid artery is medial, the internal jugular vein is lateral, and the vagus nerve runs posteriorly. Therefore, when placing the internal jugular line, the physician should aim the needle lateral to the common carotid artery. 

## Abdomen

### Acute mesenteric ischemia

Acute mesenteric ischemia presents with tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal tenderness and guarding, and metabolic acidosis.

L-Lactic acid is produced in the cytoplasm of the cell in anaerobic conditions and can cause metabolic acidosis in the setting of ischemia. Glycolysis is the biochemical pathway in which glucose is oxidized to pyruvate within the cytosol. In anaerobic conditions such as ischemia, pyruvate is converted to L-lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase within the cytoplasm. Subsequently, levels of serum L-lactic acid increase, resulting in metabolic acidosis. Other causes of L-lactic acidosis are sepsis and toxicity due to isoniazid, aspirin, or metformin.

D-lactic acid (exogenous lactic acid) is increased in patients with short bowel syndrome (surgical removal of the small intestine) or, less commonly, in patients with propylene glycol toxicity. In short bowel syndrome, the unabsorbed carbohydrates are metabolized by gut bacteria to D-lactic acid, increasing the serum level.

## Pathology

### Acute Kidney Injury

### Azotemias

#### Pre-renal Azotemia

BUN:Cr ratio is increased (>15) due to the renal tubule reabsorbing BUN along with other solutes in the setting of intravascular volume depletion. Creatinine is not reabsorbed, so the BUN:Cr ratio is high.

Decreased renal perfusion can also produce prerenal azotemia with increased BUN and normal serum creatinine (BUN:Cr > 15), but you should remember that the urine output should be decreased to <500 mL/24 hours as a consequence of inadequate perfusion.

#### Renal Azotemia

Tubular dysfunction prevents BUN from being reabsorbed, so the BUN:Cr ratio falls (<15)

#### Post-renal Azotemia

Obstruction of the urinary tract can initally cause an increased BUN:Cr ratio (>15) as a result of the back pressure increasing the time available for BUN reabsorption. However, as this progresses to tubular damage (late stages), the BUN:Cr ratio drops (<15) since BUN reabsorption is reduced.

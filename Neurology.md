## Pathology

### Neoplasms

#### Glioblastoma

Located within the white matter of the brain. Manifest with nonspecific neurological symptoms. Can cross the midline of the brain as "butterfly gliomas". On MRI, the tumor would appear as a ring-enhancing mass due to central necrosis. Toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphomas will also show up as ring-enhancing masses.

#### Hemangioblastomas

Highly vascularized, infratentorial brain tumors that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of VHL disease. present with features of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, vomiting, blurred vision, papilledema). 

##### Histology 

Densely packed, thin-walled capillary vessels surrounded by large stromal cells with intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions. 

#### Oligodendroglioma

##### Histology

Fried egg cells and a chicken-wire pattern of capillary anastamoses.

### Neurocutaneous disorders

#### VHL Disease

## Microbiology

### Congenital toxoplasmosis

#### Signs

chorioretinitis (inflammation of the retina and the choroid or the vascular tissue of the eye), diffuse intracranial calcifications, and hydrocephalus (indicated by ventriculomegaly) in a new born.

#### Caused by

*Toxoplasma gondii* infection during pregnancy. Consumption of contaminated, undercooked pork. Can also be due to contact with contaminated cat feces.

## Physiology

### Cranial Nerves

#### CN III

Motor - extraocular muscles -- affected primarily by vascular disease (diabetes: glucose -> sorbitol)

##### CN III Palsy

A "down-and-out" gaze with ptosis.

#### CN IX Glossopharyngeal nerve

Somatic motor - Stylopharyngeus muscle only (elevates larynx while swallowing)

Parasympathethic - Inferior salivatory nucleus -> CN IX -> optic ganglion -> travels along the auriculotemporal nerve (CN V3) -> Parotid gland secretion

General sensory - Tympanic membrane (inner surface), eustachian tube, posterior third of the tongue, tonsillar region, upper pharynx (afferent portion of gag reflex), carotid body and sinus

### Major functions of the hypothalamic nuclei

- Ventromedial: mediates satiety; destruction leads to hyperphagia
- Lateral: mediates hunger; destruction leads to anorexia
- Anterior: mediates heat dissipation; destruction leads to hyperthermia
- Posterior: mediates heat mediates heat conservation; destruction leads to hypothermia
- Arcuate: secretion of dopamine and inhibits prolactin, GHRH
- Medial preoptic: Secretion of GnRH, regulates sexual behavior
- Paraventricular: Secretion of oxytocin, CRH, TRH, & small amounts of ADH
- Supraoptic: Secretion of ADH & small amounts of oxytocin
- Suprachiasmatic: Circadian rhythm regulation & pineal gland. In particular, it processes light information from the retina and modulates body temperature and the production of hormones such as melatonin and cortisol. This structure also plays an important role in Jet Lag, or the insomnia and daytime sleepiness that one experiences when traveling across the world.

### Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) vs Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) Lesions

#### Upper Motor Neuron lesions

- Pronator drift: Pronator drift on exam is consistent with central nervous system (CNS) lesions (ie, stroke), which present with upper motor neuron findings. In pronator drift, the upper limb will drift down and the palm will drift toward the floor due to the muscle imbalance between the supinator and pronator muscles. If the lesion is confined to one side of the brain (such as in a left cerebral infarct), the contralateral side of the body controlled by that area of the brain will be involved (in this case, right pronator drift).

#### Lower Motor Neuron lesions

#### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 

ALS is a neurogenerative motor neuron disease (upper and lower). Patients often have a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs, although the deficits may initially be asymmetric. Lower motor neuron signs (fasciculations, flaccid weakness, muscle atrophy) and upper motor neuron signs (spastic weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) are both seen. The lifespan after symptom development is typically 3 to 5 years, with death frequently due to respiratory failure.

ALS results in degeneration of the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts that derive from the cerebral cortex motor neurons. It also causes degeneration of the motor fibers that project from the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord.

## Pathology

### Painful disorders

#### Trigeminal neuralgia

Chronic pain syndrome characterized by recurrent shooting pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. 

### Neoplasms

#### Glioblastoma

Located within the white matter of the brain. Manifest with nonspecific neurological symptoms. Can cross the midline of the brain as "butterfly gliomas". On MRI, the tumor would appear as a ring-enhancing mass due to central necrosis. Toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphomas will also show up as ring-enhancing masses.

#### Hemangioblastomas

Highly vascularized, infratentorial brain tumors that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of VHL disease. present with features of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, vomiting, blurred vision, papilledema). 

##### Histology 

Densely packed, thin-walled capillary vessels surrounded by large stromal cells with intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions. 

#### Oligodendroglioma

##### Histology

Fried egg cells and a chicken-wire pattern of capillary anastamoses.

#### Pinealoma

Childhood tumor of the dorsal midbrain that compresses the pretectal region, resulting in vertical gaze palsy. Because of the close proximity to the cerebral aqueduct, hydrocephalus (due to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow pathway) can also develop, which would explain this patient's increased intracranial pressure. The most common type of pinealoma in children is germinoma, which often secretes Î²-hCG, stimulating testosterone production and causing precocious puberty in boys.

### Neural tube defects

Occur when the neural folds fail to fuse in the region of the anterior or posterior neuropores. Persistent communication between the spinal canal and the amniotic cavity allows leakage of AFP and AChE into the amniotic fluid, leading to elevated levels of both AFP and AChE that can be detected on amniocentesis.

### Neurocutaneous disorders

#### Neurofibramatosis type I (von Ricklinghausen disease) AD

Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Patients characteristically develop numerous cutaneous neurofibromas comprised mostly of Schwann cells, which are embryologically derived from the neural crest cells.

#### VHL Disease

#### Tuberous Sclerosis

## Microbiology

### Bacterial Meningitis

#### Signs

Fever, headache, and a positive Brudzinski sign (involuntary flexion of the knees and hips when the neck is flexed)

#### Caused by

##### *Neisseria meningitidis*

Gram-negative diplococci. Note that meningococcal meningitis can cause Waterhouse-Friderichson syndrome which is an endotoxin-triggered coagulopathy and is characterized by adrenal hemorrhage and primary adrenal insufficiency. This also leads to petechiae, and purpura, a non-blanching rash, DIC, respiratory failure and shock.

### Congenital toxoplasmosis

#### Signs

Chorioretinitis (inflammation of the retina and the choroid or the vascular tissue of the eye), diffuse intracranial calcifications, and hydrocephalus (indicated by ventriculomegaly) in a new born.

#### Caused by

##### *Toxoplasma gondii*

infection during pregnancy. Consumption of contaminated, undercooked pork. Can also be due to contact with contaminated cat feces.

In an immunocompromised patient, multiple **ring-enhancing lesions** within the subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, and/or thalamus are highly suggestive of cerebral toxoplasmosis. *Toxoplasma gondii* is an obligate intracellular parasite, contracted via ingestion of cysts in raw meat or oocysts in cat feces. In immunocompetent patients, the presentation is usually asymptomatic. 

###### Treatment

Cerebral toxoplasmosis is treated with a combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine.

## Vasculitidies

### Large-vessel vasculitis

### Medium-vessel vasculitis

### Small-vessel vasculitis

#### Behçet syndrome

Increased incidence in people of Turkish and easteren Mediterranean descent. Recurrent apthous ulvers, genital ulcerations, uveitis, erythema nodosum. Can be precipitated by HSV or parvovirus. Flares last 1-4 weeks.

This is a type III hypersenitivity immune complex vasculitis. Associated with HLA-B51.

#### Granulomatosis with polyangitis

Affects the upper respiratory tract: perforation of nasal septum (which can present as recurrent nosebleeds), chronic sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis. Also affects the lower respiratory tract: hemoptysis, cough, and dyspnea. Can also present with hematuria and red cell casts.

Should be thinking of BLOOD: blood in the nose (perforation of the nasal septum leading to nosebleeds), blood in the cough (hemoptysis), and blood in the urine (hematuria, and red blood cell casts).

The common triad is focal necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing granulomas in the lung and upper airway, and necrotizing glomerulonephritis. It is associated with PR3-ANCA/c-ANCA (anti-proteinase 3). Chest X-ray shows large nodular densities.

Treatment is with glucocorticoids in combination with rituximab or cyclophosphamide.

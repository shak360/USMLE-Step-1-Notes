## Fragile-X Syndrome

Caused by an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats on the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the long arm of the X chromosome. This leads to hypermethylation and inactivation of FMR1.

## Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF)

Blotchy red muscle fibers on Gomori trichrome stain are characteristic of mitochondrial myopathies. Male patients cannot transmit their mitochondrial DNA to their offspring.
